# Temperature Output N' Integrative Cooling (TONIC)
This is a PID temperature controller designed for the VODCA cryo-microscope.

The Vienna Optical Droplet Crystallization Analyzer (VODCA) is a cryo-microscope with a broad range of applications, ranging from high-speed analysis of interfacial freezing to observing freezing processes on the order of 5 um droplets. The Temperature Output Nâ€™ Integrative Cooling (TONIC) program mediates cross-talk between a power supply, thermocouple, and a Peltier element to control the temperature ramp using a PID feedback system.

## Installation
Provided you have a code editor such as Visual Studio Code on Win 8/10:
Install required packages using pip on the console:

```
example of installation with pip:

pip install [] 
$ python -m pip install []

Required Packages:

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install colorama
pip install pandas
pip install bk_precision_1900
pip install nidaqmx
pip install scipy
```
After installing the packages, ensure the scripts can communicate with the power supply and the thermocouple. 


installed it can be run by executing the PID_main.py script when it is in a folder containing all scripts downloaded from Github.
